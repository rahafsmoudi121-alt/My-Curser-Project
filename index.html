    <h2>What Are Web Cursors?</h2>
    <p>Web cursors are the visual indicators, typically a pointer,
            that show the position of a user's mouse or touchpad on a web page and allow them
             to interact with elements by clicking, hovering, or scrolling. <br> <br> Websites can
         use default cursors or customize them with different shapes, colors, and effects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to match the site's design and provide feedback.</p>
